# Clustering for Data Analysis: Unveiling Patterns in Seismic Events 🌍📊
This project focuses on analyzing and clustering seismic event data in Indonesia to identify hidden patterns in earthquake distribution. By utilizing key attributes such as depth, magnitude, and geographic location, we aim to classify seismic activities and gain deeper insights into their behavior.

With a dataset of over 9,000 earthquake records, this analysis provides valuable information to enhance disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies, contributing to a more resilient response system for earthquake-prone regions. 🌏⚡
